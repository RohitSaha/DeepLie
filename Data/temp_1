Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges .
Secondly , we should help Americans purchase their own coverage , through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts  but it must be the plan they want , not the plan forced on them by the Government .
Thirdly , we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out .
Fourthly , we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance  and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately .
Finally , the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines  creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care .
Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed . Every problem can be solved . And every hurting family can find healing , and hope .
